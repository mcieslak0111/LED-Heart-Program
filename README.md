orignaly made for a soldering workshop (2/28/2023) at Penn State Harrisburg.

The schematic and board files can be located on the home page of the repository and the Arduino Program
for the ATTINY85V microcontroller can be found in the Final-Workshop-Program folder.

For this program it is important that the ATTINY85V microcontroller is using its 8MHz internal oscillator.
